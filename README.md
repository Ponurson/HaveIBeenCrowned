# HaveIBeenCrowned

Project created as entry in Hack the Crisis: Tech for Good hackathon(https://www.guaana.com/challenge/dSvc4QnSmsSvmDG5k/results/4fTtLGpD2CRytd9Gy/junuZwcvDfv65erKL/main).
The idea is everybody to learn if they have been in contact with someone infected in the past 14 days. 
It works by comparing location history obtained by user from Google timeline and database stored location histories 
donated by people with positive corona test outcome. It solves problem of spreading disease as people who are aware that they could have catched 
the virus can now contact authorities and self quarantine.
